## Character Creation

### My character belongs to the Dragon Clan

* Ring Increase: +1 Fire
* Skill Increase: +1 Meditation
* Status: 30
* Paramaunt: Sincerity
* Insignificant: Duty and Loyalty

> What does your character know?
>
> All Dragon Clan characters have a greater awareness of the following topics
> * You have a general awareness of the politics within Dragon lands. 
You can name major family heads and other leaders, and you know their respective positions and allegiances.
> * You know more about monastic life and traditions than most other clans, having likely interacted with the Togashi Order throughout your life.
> * Due to the rugged nature of your homeland, you know how to properly prepare mountain flora and wildlife for human consumption.
> * You have a working understanding of many physical phenomena of the natu- ral world, which others dismiss as uninteresting or beneath their station.

> What Does Bushidō Mean to Your Clan?
> 
> Sincerity—aligning one’s words and deeds with one’s intentions—is the greatest virtue to the Dragon Clan. In this way, its samurai may remain true to themselves even if they should fail.
> 
> While members of the Dragon Clan take their obligations seriously, they define Duty and Loyalty somewhat differently than most other samurai. 
To a Dragon, unquestioning loyalty is not loyalty at all, and Dragon Clan lords have been known to tolerate and even value criticism that others would see as grave insubordination.

### My character belongs to the Kitsuki Family

* Ring Increase: +1 Air or **+1 Water**
* Skill Increases: +1 Government, +1 Sentiment
* Glory: 44
* Starting Wealth: 6 koku

As befits the odd nature of their clan, even the courtiers of the Dragon are unusual: the samurai of the Kitsuki family are most well-known for their keen perception and their investigative techniques that rely upon physical evidence. 
They bring to the physical world the same attention to detail that the Agasha bring to spiritual matters.
A small family, they serve the Empire as magistrates and the Dragon Clan as courtiers. 
In both roles, their eye for deception and knack for finding the truth serve them well.

This contradicts the existing order of things and endangers relations with other families.

They are welcome to come back when they find a great story.

My character believes feudal lords interprete bushido to their advantage.
The Dragon Clas is the closest, yet far from the truth.

This belief challanges traditional hierarchy structure in peaceful times.
My character takes his loyalty to the Dragon Clan first, but his ideal is for everyone to surve the emperor directly.
