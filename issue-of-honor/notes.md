## Traits

### Famously lucky

“A master is one who leaves their mark upon the
world through their endeavors. In such undertakings,
four great influences may affect the outcome:
Proficiency, Preparedness, Destiny, and Luck.
Despite humanity’s beliefs, the greatest of these is Luck.”
– Tao of Shinsei

* Types: Fame, Interpersonal
* Effects: The following apply to a character with the
* Famously Lucky distinction:

Other people have heard of you for your good
fortune, and they believe it by default unless
given evidence to the contrary.
When performing a check for which you need
to leverage your reputation for having things
turn out your way (such as a Command Void
check to get your troops to put their faith
in you utterly or a Games Void check to let
fate decide the match), you may reroll up to
two dice.

### Blunt

“You look terrible, my lord.”

* Types: Interpersonal
* Effects: The following apply to a character with the
* Bluntness adversity:

You have difficulty expressing things indirectly,
and you overlook insinuations and implications
in the statements of others unless they are
pointed out to you directly.
When you make a check to create or interpret
subtext (such as a Design Air check to select
a wardrobe that conveys the proper subtle
message to your intended recipient or a Sen-
timent Air check to read someone’s unstated
feelings), you must choose and reroll two dice
containing  or . After resolving the check, if
you failed, you gain 1 Void point.

### Storyteller

A person with the ability to weave a tale by a fireside
will often find that they need no coin for food or drink,
and, if the stories are particularly good, an innkeeper
may offer a room (or at least a bale of hay in the stable)
in return for entertaining the customers for an evening.
A storyteller must be careful to choose the right stories
for a particular audience, however. Tales considered by
the locals to be scandalous or insulting may result in
the necessity of a quick exit.

* Types: Mental, Interpersonal
* Effects: The following apply to a character with the
* Stories passion:

You can recall any story you have been told,
including the details that others would gloss
over or forget.
After performing a check to recall or tell a story
(such as a Performance [Earth] check to spin a
tale to hearten comrades or a Theology [Earth]
check to recite a passage from the Tao of Shin-
sei or Akodo’s Leadership that is applicable to
your situation), you remove 3 strife.

### Impatient

Historians tell the story of the Battle of Thunder Plain in
1005, when the Iuchi family daimyō, in his impatience to
attack a Kaiu village of the Crab Clan, brought his cavalry
across the plain held sacred by the Order of Osano-wo.
The order, the most martial order of the Brotherhood
of Shinsei, attacked the Unicorn cavalry with polearms.
When the Iuchi daimyō called upon the Fortunes for
defense, the kami showed their disfavor by refusing to
respond. The cavalry were soundly defeated, and they
were forced to retreat back to Unicorn lands.

* Types: Mental
* Effects: The following apply to a character with the
* Impatience anxiety:

You find it difficult to repress yourself, and
when you are forced to wait, it causes you pal-
pable discomfort. If given the choice between
seizing an opportunity and waiting for a better
moment, you strive to seize the opportunity
despite risks that might be mitigated if you
act later.

After performing a check to strategically weigh
your options (such as a Government [Earth]
check to think of a historical anecdote related
to your situation or a Tactics [Earth] check to
identify the right moment to strike), you receive
3 strife. If this is the first time this has occurred
this scene, gain 1 Void point.

### Painfully honest

A popular, if bawdy, song at many roadside inns in
Rokugan, “The Honest Husband” is the story of a
staunch-hearted farmer who can never tell a lie. The
song progresses through several verses where he is
faced with questions from his wife about her weight,
the attractiveness of her sister, and other increasingly
risky (and risqué) situations. The song’s refrain of “you
know I love you, dearest, but I cannot tell a lie” has
become on its own a catchphrase, used jokingly when
a person is asked difficult questions.

* Types: Interpersonal
* Effects: The following apply to a character with the
* Painful Honesty anxiety:


You are tormented by internal conflict when you
lie or allow a lie to pass. You cannot make claims
you know to be false, although you can say
technically truthful things that imply untruths, if
politeness or circumstances demand it.
After you make a check to mislead someone
else (such as a Courtesy Air check to falsely
besmirch someone’s reputation or a Command
Air check to manipulate an underling), you
receive 3 strife. If this is the first time this has
occurred this scene, gain 1 Void point.

## Terms

Ometsuke was a governmental post in the Edo period belonging to Roju (the second highest post in the Edo bakufu government) in the government system, and played a role of an inspector who watched daimyo (Japanese feudal lord), koke (privileged families under Tokugawa Shogunate), and the Imperial court to protect the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) from rebellion of these powers.

Village in Unicorn lands, near Windgatherer's castle.  

Not many visitors during winter, grows with early spring.
The village is often used by traveler's refuge for a night.
Many travel to a near trading post (Windgatherer's castle?).

## Events

Kiyoshi arrives to Konomura and plays with the children.
Villagers are respectful to her.
She plans to stay the night.

She gave a coin to Aki.

Gaku arrives, sees above and feels dissatisfaction with it.

I've met Tatsue on the road.
I recognized her, but did not reveal that.
She travels openly.
After a short conversation, she rides her house off, leaving me on foot to travel the rest of the way.

Kiyoshi and Gaku speak in the inn.
Gaku searchs for some woman, but Kiyoshi has not seen her.
He does not tell what exactly.

Gaku accidently suggests "to warm Kiyoshi's night", even though he did not mean anything sexual.
She ignored this interpretation.

Tatsue arrives at the inn, leaves her hourse and enters.
She meets an old woman and asks to be occomponied to her room.
Then she follows into the inn hall and gets to know others.

Gaku continues to search for the woman, but now she has another appearance.
Tatsue suggests that it might be my character. :facepalm

He comes to meet me but I don't meet his expectations.
I may have been a bit blunt.

Aki meets me by the inn.

Tatsue continues smalltalk with Kiyoshi.

I enter.
Tatsue suggest to enter poetic debate, but I refuse, revealing I know her name.
I sit so that I can listen and observe people:
* Four men are dining;
* Aki is running around;
* Old lady is moving through the inn.

When Gaku returns, we converse about his search.
But now he has the third appearance described.
Tatsue and Kiyoshi confront Gaku, but he disregards those insinuation.

We decided to go see glooming plum in the light of the setting sun.
Tatsue fetches her horse, that I remembered was in the shadowlands.
Kiyoshi, once learns that, pets the horse.

Gaku composes a hoku.
I collect it in my journal.

Other trees are not blooming.
Not blooming ever.
Kiyoushi detects... blight.
A fading sound of it.

A scream.
Sudden scream cuts through the evening silence.
Woman's scream.

Tatsue and Kiyoshi take less than a moment to sadle the hourse and ride it back to the inn.
Gaku and I follow.

Aki is unconcious, pale on the floor.
Kiyoshi tries to take a look: she has fast pulse, she is very hot and struggles to breath.

I noticed that grandmother looks from afar.
I followed through the rooms, and heard something strange.
A person's heavy breath.
I entered a dark room and found a cold, slowly pulsating body.

-- Tsutomu, is that you? -- grandmother also enters the room.
I request help but she avoids the subject.
Tatsue, who followed me, lights a lantern and, concerned with the risk of infection, leads me and grandmother out.

Once we are out, she tells he fell ill since the beginning of winter.
He started talking about a woman, ran away from the house and returned ill.
Herbalist could not help him.

Gaku notices that herbalist Ume is concealing something.
He starts a social duel with her.
-- What do you want from me, master samurai?

In the meantime, Kiyoshi consults with the spirits of the land.
They reveal that blight has poisened the village.

Tatsue enters the hall and witnesses Gaku's attack on Ume.
Tatsue backs his fellow samurai.

I meet Kiyoshi and we ride back to the inn.
She is confident we need to find the source of blight.

Ume finally tells Tsutomu took his life.
His monther wanted to bring him back for anything.
Ume agreed.

Beforehand, Ume met a travelling woman, and bought a reviving potion.
When she tried in on Tsutomu, he rose and was well: could speak, could walk... she stops.
She still conseals something.

Tatsue tries to unseal her leaps.
Tsutomu liked Ume before, but after that he dropped cold.
Tatsue forgave her.

Fact: Ume could not remember how the samurai, who sold her the potion, looked.
She also said, that grandmother was only 45 years old.

Kiyoshi and all the rest of us follow Ume to her house, where the rest of the potion is left.
When the bottle is in Kiyoshi's hands, she investigates it and... almost tries it.
"Life is energy. If somebody can grant life, it needs to be taken first", sounds in Kiyoshi's head.

Ume breaks down from what she's done.
Tatsue tries to relief her, but I object.
_Samurai cannot be blind to evil._

Gaku composes one of his best poems.
Here, in this gods forgotten hat of a common herbalist, he's found beauty.

Tatsue and Kiyoshi interrigate Gaku, but he still did not tell anything.

When we returned back, grandmother, who was even more old now, demanded Ume's blood and the potion.
She attacked Kiyoshi, but could not keep it on her legs.
She was restrained.

We went to Tsutomu, who was breating even heavier.
He looks dead, but yet moving.
Kiyoshi investigated the body, and it the took effort for her to remain consious.
She takes her last and purifies the body, sending whatever kept Tsutomo alive.
If that state can be called so.

Aki wakes up.
I share the fate of her family with her, and she accepts.

The end.
